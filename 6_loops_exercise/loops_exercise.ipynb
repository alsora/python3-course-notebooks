    "You performed an experiment where you observed the state of a system every hour.\n",
    "The observed state at a given instant is a single odd number.\n",
    "However, not all the values you obtained from the experiment are valid:\n",
    " - `99` is the full scale value of the observation tool: it indicates that nothing was observed at that time, so it's invalid.\n",
    " - `-1` indicates a fault in the observation tool: it's invalid and also all the successive values in the sequence are invalid.\n",
    " - even values denote noise in the observation tool: they are invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the many problems that can affect your experiment, you repeated it multiple times.\n",
    "Every list variable (from `a` to `f`) contains all the observation that you got from a single experiment.\n",
    "Note that trials had different durations, so the number of observations may be different in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each experiment, you should store the sum of all the valid observations in the `results` list.\n",
    "If there are no valid observations, the sum should be `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you have to validate the `results` with some control values.\n",
    "For each control value, discard the results that are higher than that (i.e. set them to `0`).\n",
    "You should take note (i.e. print) how many experiment results are invalidated by each control value and how many valid results are left at the end."
