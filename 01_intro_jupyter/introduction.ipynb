    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The currently selected cell is identified by a colored rectangle that surrounds it.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Notebook is made of cells and each of them can be of some different types.\n",
    "\n",
    " - Markdown cell: it's a cell that contains standard text or images. It's used to provide descriptions or notes about what the code will do. Markdown cells are editable. This whole block of text is a markdown cell!  Double click on this cell to start editing it if you want! When you are done with your editing and you want to \"save\" the cell, just press [SHIFT + Enter] or the `Run` button in the bar at the top of the notebook.\n",
    " - Code cell: it's a cell that contains Python code which can be executed. The second cell in this document is a code cell (i.e. the block that starts with `print(\"This is ...`. You will notice that code cells are always in editable mode. On the left of a code cell you will find the text `In [ ]:`. A code cell allows to execute the Python code it contains by running it: you have to select it and then press [SHIFT + Enter] or the `Run` button in the bar at the top of the notebook. Note that after running the cell, an increasing number will appear at its left. This number indicates the order in which the code cells have been run in the whole Notebook.\n",
    " - Output cell: this is a cell that is automatically generated when running a code cell that produces (i.e. displays) some data. If a code cell produces some output, this will be displayed immediately after it, with the text `Out [ ]:` and a number matching the one of the input. Running again a code cell will \"refresh its output\". You can't directly edit an output cell. Its content is univocally determined by the code cell just before it. Modifying the content of the code cell and running it again will produce a different output cell."
