    "Write a block of code that does the following task:\n",
    "for each `x` value, this has to be multiplied with each of the `y` values.\n",
    "For each `x` value, it should also check if the sum of all these products is greater than the threshold and print a message accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hints:\n",
    " - Use a nested `for` loop and a counter.\n",
    " - Try to understand the key difference between this execise and the previous one, in particular **where the counter should be initialized**.\n",
    " - Only the first two `x` values (`4` and `6.28`) will have a sum of products greater than the threshold"
