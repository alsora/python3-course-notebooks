This was correct because `0` is the smallest non-negative number, so any number in the list would have been greater or equal than that. On the other hand, if you are looking for the smallest number (or the least number of occurrences) you will have to initialize the variable to a value such that every possible value that you will find will be smaller or equal to that. A safe bet, is to initialize it to a huge number (e.g. 1000000000000) and then to assume that your list will only contain smaller elements. This is not very robust, as in a real application you never know all the possible input in advance. Considering this exercise, a possible solution is to initialize the variable to be equal to the length of the string, as this number is obviously greater than the number of occurrences of any character in it.\n",
