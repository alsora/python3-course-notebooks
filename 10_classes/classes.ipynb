    "For example you can have as many **list** as you want in your program, all with different values, and you can use the same **methods** or **functions** on all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** is characterized by some internal data (e.g. 1 integer number in case of **int** or some key-value pairs in case of **dictionary**), which represents its **state**.\n",
    "A **class** can be mutable or immutable, depending on if it's possible to change its **state**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **class** provides **methods** that can either give information about its state (e.g. the `count()` **method** for **strings**) or can modify the state (e.g. the `append()` **method** for **lists**).\n",
