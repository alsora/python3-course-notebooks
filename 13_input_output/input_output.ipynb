    "### File paths\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use a file in your program you have to specify the so called file path.\n",
    "The file path is a string that tells Python which file you want to work with.\n",
    "In the simplest case, if the file is in the same directory as your Python program, it's sufficient to provide the name of the file as file path.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file is not in the same directory as your Python program, things are a little bit more complicated.\n",
    "You have 2 alternative ways for specifying the path:\n",
    " - The **absolute path** is a path that starts from the root directory of your computer and traverses a bunch of directories until it reaches the desired file. It will be something like `/home/username/Downloads/filename.txt`. You can find the absolute path of a file by opening a terminal in the directory where the file is and executing the command `realpath FILENAME`, or with a right click on the file and checking its information. An absolute path in Linux always starts with the slash `/` symbol.\n",
    " - The **relative path** is a path that starts from the directory where your Python program is. For example if you have a directory named `files` that contains your file named `filename.txt`, the relative path will be `files/filename.txt`. Note how there is no slash `/` symbol at the beginning. The case where you only specify the file name mentioned above is just a particular case of a relative path."
